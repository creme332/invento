## Installation

Clone repository using Git (or otherwise):
```bash
git clone git@github.com:creme332/invento.git
```

Navigate to project:
```bash
cd invento
```

### Backend

To install backend dependencies:
```bash
cd server
npm install
```

If you don't already have a MongoDB database named `invento`, create one with MongoDB Atlas. Set the initial collection as `Collection0`.

In the `server` folder create a `.env` file  with the following contents:
```bash
# Replace with mongo connection string
MONGO_STRING="mongodb+srv://cooluser:coolpassword@cluster0.lz91hw2.mongodb.net/invento?retryWrites=true&w=majority"
ADMIN_KEY="1234" # Admin key to delete item/category
```
> ðŸ”´ **Note**: Do not forget the `invento?` option in your connection string.

Create required database and add sample data:

```bash
node populatedb
```

> ðŸŸ¢ **Note**: You may now delete the previously created collection `Collection0`.

To start local server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Backend is deployed at [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001).

### Frontend

To install dependencies for frontend:
```bash
cd client
npm install
```

To run the development server locally:
```bash
npm run dev
```

Frontend is deployed at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
