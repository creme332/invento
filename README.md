To add sample data to your database:

To populate your database:

node populatedb
```

> ðŸŸ¢ **Note**: You may now delete the previously created collection `Collection0`.

To start local server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Backend is deployed at [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001).

```bash
cd client
npm install
